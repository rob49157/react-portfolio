            <p> One day you‚Äôll look ahead of you at that dreaded hill that always kills your legs, put your head down, pedal as far as you can, and then walk your bike the rest of the way, just like you always do‚Ä¶except this time without realizing it, you‚Äôre already going down the other side, and you didn‚Äôt even notice. There is no better feeling in the world than the day you weigh yourself and you realize you‚Äôve lost weight.
              It can only be rivalled when you realize you‚Äôve been playing with your kids for an hour straight and they‚Äôve tired before you have. It‚Äôs a phenomenal feeling, and in my experience, better even than the runner‚Äôs high.
              This state mind opens my mind to think outside the box and solve the problems I have in front of me</p>
