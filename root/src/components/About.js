            <p> One day youâ€™ll look ahead of you at that dreaded hill that always kills your legs, put your head down, pedal as far as you can, and then walk your bike the rest of the way, just like you always doâ€¦except this time without realizing it, youâ€™re already going down the other side, and you didnâ€™t even notice. There is no better feeling in the world than the day you weigh yourself and you realize youâ€™ve lost weight.It can only be rivalled when you realize youâ€™ve been playing with your kids for an hour straight and theyâ€™ve tired before you have. Itâ€™s a phenomenal feeling, and in my experience, better even than the runnerâ€™s high.</p>
